EDA:
-Missing one dimensional visualizations(bar charts and dot plots)
-Need to execute the changes that needed to be made to the data
-Didn't add any conclusions to the correlation calculations
-Didn't made any conclusions from the outliers that we attempted to find
EFA:
-Need to use eigen() to find the intrinisnic dimensionality of the predictor and response variables
-Need to use pca() to extract orthogonally and obliquely rotated loading matrices
-Need to use pca() to summarize and interprete the variance and covariances of the rotated loading matrix
